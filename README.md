## Help App !

The app matches people who need help with people who have resources to help. By using GPS, the app frees users from having to describe where they are; which can be easily done by the mobile device users communicate their location by pressing just two or three buttons.This will be recorded on Azure server and push notifications can be sent out to the users who have the resources to help those in need.

The app will also direct the users to the safest positions based on the data it collects from the devices of other users who have identified the safe zones. There they can find the necessary supplies and shelter. 

The app will also help the users mark themselves safe, in case they do not have access to internet by connecting to the Bluetooth devices in the safe zone and the Bluetooth device can send the data ( device UUID ) to the Azure server and the family members of the lost person can know that he/she is safe. For this the app will record the UUID of the devices in the family beforehand and will put it in a look up table.
